# EncameraCore

EncameraCore provides the underlying architecture for [Encamera](https://encamera.app). 

The functionality provided in this library primarily relates to:

* Management of encryption keys in your keychain
* Media capture and encryption
* Disk I/O
* Authentication via Biometrics and password

This includes almost everything for the app's core functionality except the UI components.
